1) Getting Started

    Prerequisites
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the necessary packages by running:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
    Running the Analysis
    Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Saqlain_o9/amazon_sales_analysis.git
    cd amazon_sales_analysis


2) Run Jupyter Notebooks: Open each notebook in the notebooks/ directory to execute the analysis step-by-step.

    load_data.ipynb to load and inspect the data.
    clean_data.ipynb to preprocess and clean data.
    exploratory_analysis.ipynb to explore data insights with visualizations.
    modeling.ipynb to build and evaluate predictive models.


3) Run Scripts: If desired, you can execute individual scripts from the src/ directory. For example:
     python src/descriptive_stats.py


Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:

Understand sales trends: Identify seasonal trends and top-selling products.
Feature Engineering: Generate useful features for deeper insights and modeling.
Sales Prediction: Use machine learning to predict future sales based on historical data.
